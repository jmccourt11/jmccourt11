# Hi there, I'm Joseph (Joey) McCourt! 👋  

### 🧪 About Me  
I’m a physicist and postdoctoral researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, working at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). My research focuses on **X-ray scattering, diffraction, and imaging**, leveraging high-brightness synchrotron sources to study the **assembly and characterization of nanomaterials**.  

### 🔬 Interests
- **X-ray Scattering & Imaging** – Exploring reciprocal (Fourier) space characterization
- **Nanomaterials** – Understanding the collective properties and structure of nano-scale assemblies  
- **AI for Scientific Discovery** – Applying machine learning to analyze, model, and characterize materials   
- **Self-Assembly & Molecular Dynamics Simulations** – Studying soft matter emergent properties and dynamics
